This thesis is structured into eight chapters, each contributing to a step in the development and validation of a Bayesian framework for near real-time monitoring of European carbon emissions. Here we share the code related to the analysis chapters we have in our thesis. Files are ordered in the number sequence as same as the chapter number. Chapter 4 focuses on Carbon Monitor data, including a discussion of its temporal trends, the uncertainty in reported emissions, and a detailed exploratory data analysis across countries and sectors. Chapter 5 shifts to the socio-economic dimension, introducing the SDG-aligned indicators, data integration methods, and visual summaries that support the composite index. Chapter 6 presents the spline-based smoothing of daily emissions and the Bayesian clustering of countries, covering GMM, BGMM, and NumPyro implementations, with evaluation metrics and cluster stability checks. Chapter 7 details the construction of the Carbon Sustainability Index (CSI) using Bayesian Latent Variable Modeling. It includes model design, implementation, posterior predictive checks, and clustering countries based on CSI trajectories.
